# Templates

This subfolders contains all templates regarding plots or any other (public) file. If these templates are followed by everyone, we should all have uniform looking plots. If you want to add anything, please do so via a pull request. 

Please use our matplotlib style file by placing the following in your code
```
plt.style.use('~/Templates/TrackingDetector_style.mplstyle')
```
For any command not specified in this file, matplotlib will use the standard style specified. [See this overview for the standards](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/v3.3.4/matplotlibrc.template?utm_source=pocket_mylist)
